## Key Insights  
* 🚀 **Consistent Revenue Growth:** Revenue has been continuously growing, indicating steady customer interest and successful business operations.
* 📅 **Peak Days Identified:** Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays are the busiest days across all locations, aligning with typical work schedules.
* ⏰ **Peak Hours Analysis:** Morning hours see the highest customer traffic, particularly as people head to work.
* 🥇 **Top-Selling Product:** Coffee is the leading category, with Barista Espresso being the best-selling product across all stores.

## Additional Insights  
* 📈 **Significant Revenue Spike in May:** A notable increase in revenue was observed in May, likely due to the holiday season. This trend suggests the need for better resource management during peak months.
* 📉 **Underperforming Products:** Specific flavors, coffee beans, and merchandise (particularly clothing in Hell’s Kitchen) are among the lowest-selling items.
